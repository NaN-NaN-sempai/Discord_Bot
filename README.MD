In '/bots/':

the main script get the bot's informations from the bot file in the folder 'bots', so create your bot file here
in the case of this file: /bots/example.jsonc
the 'index.js' file in the folder reads all files, aside himself, from the folder and deliver to the main script
so dont edit, move or delete it

the script accepts json and jsonc (json with comments) files

this example file is a jsonc to allow comments and just for it
in your bot you can just create a normal json file
but if you use a jsonc file, it will work as well

if you are in a json file and want to comment on in
in VSCode, click on "JSON" in the right bottom corner,
then type jsonc and press enter to enable json with comments.
